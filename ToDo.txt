Create additional levels

Make a 'level victory' check

Load the next level when the first one is finished

Done - Redo paddle collisions to prevent the ball bouncing up from below the paddle

Create better art assets

When the game starts the ball should be stationary on the paddle. The player hits a button to launch it (Key.up?).
