The ball doesn't reflect properly when colliding with the corners of a brick or the paddle.

Sometimes the ball hits the left side of the paddle and reflects in the wrong direction (to the right) and vice versa

Sometimes the title gets stuck and stops getting bigger and smaller

//Fixed - Ball bounces up from the bottom of the playfield. Instead it should subtract a life and reset.
